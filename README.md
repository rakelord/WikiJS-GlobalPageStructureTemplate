# WikiJS-GlobalPageStructureTemplate
How to copy a complete page tree (used for Customer templates for example)

You will first need to create an API key through the application for this to work.
Replace the text: <API KEY> with your key.
Also add your WikiJS url within the: <WIKIJSAddress>
Next you need to set which folder structure to copy in the $templateParentPath variable.
  
When all this is done you can trigger the script, but remember changing $customerName and $customerID each time you run the job!
